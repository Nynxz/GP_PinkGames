# Requirements

## 1. Multiple Scenes
The game must involve at least 4 scenes, there must be a:
    
- Loading / splash scene
- Main menu scene
- Main game scene
- Leaderboard scene

You should be able to navigate between the scenes
Note: each scene needs to only be navigable by at least one other scene (with the exception of the loading scene, it can be a time-oriented screen)

## 2. Loops
The game must use at least 3 loops which are fundamental to the operation of the program.

## 3. Arrays
The  game  must  incorporate  at  least  3  arrays,  with  at  least  1  of  the  arrays  being  used  to manage a list of objects on the screen (such as opponents).

## 4. Interactvitity
There  must  exist  player  interaction  using  a  keyboard.  The  game  needs  to  handle  at  least  3 keyboard keys

## 5. Images
There must be at least 1 image present in the final product (separate to sprites) that is drawn at an appropriate size.

Note: it is up to you which scene you incorporate the image in.

## 6. Sprites
The p5.play library must be incorporated with a minimum of 3 sprites used. The spritesmust have  collision  detection  (between  sprites)  and  must  move  independently.  Sprites  must  be animated (i.e. a moving object, changing size or color)

## 7. Video & Sound
The game should use at least 3 sounds and 1 video. Hint: you can use sounds for shooting and video to introduce the game in the main screen.

## 8. GUI Input
At least one type of GUI input is required (e.g. text input, slider, button). The input should affect what is drawn.

## 9. Data
The program needs to read in data from a JSON file where each object must have at least 3 properties. This data must be presented in the sketch in one of the scenes. 

Hint: if your themes / ideas of the main game scene conflict with using external data, use the data in the leaderboard scene.

## 10. Stability
The game must feel stable to play. Your game should not feel ‘buggy’.

## 11. Creativity
You must produce creative work that adds complexity to your game. 
Examplesof creative work that add complexity to your game include: 
- ### Having multiple types of enemies
    One may shoot lasers slowbut move fast, the other may shoot lasers fast but move slow
- ### Having a dynamic background 
    Stars (sprites or images) may traverse down the screen in a straight line, being generated at random rates & positions from the top of the screen
- ### Having multiple modes of fire
    Your ship may fire in a straight line in its unaltered state, but when picking up a ‘bonus’ blob (that traverses down the screen every 20 seconds, 30 seconds if  missed)  the  ship  has  an  altered  mode  of  fire,  such  as  shooting  in  multiple directions.
- ### UI & Fonts
    You may download and use custom fonts that better fit your theme.
- ### Score & Sound Effects
    Play  a  special  sound  every  10  enemies  destroyed  and  add  relevant  bonus scoring.
- ### Enemy health 
    Enemies  only  fall  after  being  hit  3  times.  Use  an array  to  store  the health  of individual enemies and update it upon collision detection.
- ### Ability to change the difficulty of game    
    Could be as simple as having two difficulty options that change the number of lives  available,  or  as  creative  as  having  increased  speed  of  incoming  fire  / increased toughness of opponents.

You are encouraged to create your own assets (i.e. opponents or laser fire) on top of using public assets from the internet.

Note: the  ability  to  creatively  expand  your  game  is  highly  dependant  on  having basic functionality, such as interactivity.

## 12. Code

You  must  produce  clean,  well-written  code.  This  encompasses  indentation,  meaningful naming of functions & variables, use & overuse of absolute values.
